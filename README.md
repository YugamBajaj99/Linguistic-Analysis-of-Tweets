# Linguistic Analysis of Tweets â€“ Using Data Mining to study usage of English on Twitter

**ABSTRACT**

The recent evolution in the language used by people in their day to day life has shown a major shift in 
trend in how they like to express themselves in public. With the increased use of abbreviations, 
shorthand notations, mnemonics and an introduction of a new set of hybrid words, the vocabulary 
used in communications happening between people has started to deviate from the original 
vocabulary that is traditionally used for a language. In this study, we have analyzed the data collected 
through a set of random Tweets on Twitter to see the degree of this shift from the traditional 
vocabulary. Twitter is a popular social media platform where a variety of people express themselves 
openly and this makes it a good choice to extract random samples of data without any bias. The 
tweets are extracted and analyzed by data mining techniques using the functions of the Twitter API. 
Each word is categorized into one of the two categories: words part of the vocabulary of a language, 
what we are calling here as Proper English Words and words not part of the vocabulary(The Improper 
English Words). For this study, We have restricted our experiment to the tweets made in English 
only.
